TopDrawer

TopDrawer installer Arch Linux.

[TopDrawer][homepage] is a SLAC software of which different versions are in
circulation.  For the automatic plotting after event generation MadAnalysis
needs to be able to cut a topdrawer file in smaller files, convert them to
postscript files and rotate the single plots automatically to put them in a web
page.  As the syntax for conversion and rotating plots is not the same in all
version some errors, or even a complete stop of the MadGraph/MadEvent run might
be expected if a non-default version of topdrawer is used for the automatic
plotting.
