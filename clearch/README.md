# Clearch-cli

Clearch-cli is a command-line tool written in Rust that provides a fast and efficient way to search queries using the Gemini API. It's designed to be user-friendly, offering a simple interface for performing searches directly from the command line.

## Features

- **Gemini API Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with the Gemini API to fetch search results.
- **Fast and Efficient**: Utilizes Rust's performance capabilities to deliver quick search results.
- **Minimalist CLI**: Provides a minimalist command-line interface for easy navigation and usage.

## Installation
We currently use makepkg -si. Would like to add to AUR to make it easier for everyone to use. We aim to help people intergrate gemini and LLMs in their Arch distribution.
