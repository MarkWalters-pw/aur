%
    "But... it's a family! Under what circumstances would we ever need to kill a human family? Maybe like a shitty dad... or a mob family... (Italian accent) That's understandable. (normal) But to eradicate an entire innocent--seemingly in this instance--upper middle class family bloodline?!?"
    ―Moxxie, to Millie

%
    "Well why don't YOU take an art class?!"
    ―Moxxie, after Blitzo insults him
%
    "I think you're missing the biggest issue, sir. Isn't it crucial to have a client who demands enough kills to win this bet? We aren't just going up to massacre!"
    ―Moxxie, pointing out flaws in Blitzo's plan
%
    "Sir, there is no way we're going to get enough clients by the end of the day with one, HORRIBLY SPELLED, BAD GRAMMAR FLYER!"

    ―Moxxie, about opera
%
    "Well, well. Would'ya look at that? YOU did our job for us!"
    ―Moxxie, to C.H.E.R.U.B when Lyle Lipton dies
%
    "You know, more battles were won by technological advances in warfare. I’ve researched the history of weaponry extensively.

    "I'll have a neapolitan cappuccino, more cappu than cino, make sure it's got no more than four ounces of milk (the beans won't have the right texture, otherwise), and make sure they spell my name correctly on the cup (they always put 'Foxy' or 'Roxy' I hate that). If you can't handle that I'll have a venti traditional Misto please use soy milk with two blonde shots affogato AND RISTRETTO!! I'd also love three vanilla pumps at the very bottom then add the coffee after then add--"
    ―Moxxie's coffee order
%
    "When you say 'torture' do you mean physical or psychological? Physical seems counterproductive. We would likely tell you anything if it meant an end to the pain, and you would have no way of knowing what was true."
    ―Moxxie's reply when being threatened with torture by Agent 2.
%

My lungs are full of honesty, would you promise me that you won't judge? Not trying to divulge too much, but I'm in too deep, so first of all... FUCK YOU!! This is just typical, well two can play at this game of dismay! 'Cause if YOU'RE here, causing frustration, I'm torturing you in YOUR hallucination! ♫"
    ―Moxxie, singing in his trip
%
    "I simply follow your orders, it isn't my fault if your orders are as nonsensical as a sun tanning bed left out on the cold rainy porch of a fresh April shower. I am simply speaking Satan's plain English, perhaps you should crack open a dictionary sometime and then maybe you could understand a half of the frivolous things I carry on and on about."
    ―Moxxie's hallucination when Blitzo sees him
%
    "♫Why does it seem like a recurring theme that you alienate in your toxic routine? ..... Because you're thoughtless, and cruel, and you'll end up ALONE!!♫"
    ―Moxxie, to Hallucination Blitzo

    ―Moxxie's hallucination insulting Blitzo
%
    "I believe your subconscious is trying to tell you that you simply cannot fathom proper intimacy but also crave it as well. It's rather unfortunate, sir. Considering it's often how you treat those that stand by you such as myself. Are you worried I may have enough of it one day, as well?"
    ―Moxxie's hallucination before Blitzo's trip starts to devolve
%
    "I remember. You told me I did a good job and that you were proud to work with me, I feel you wanted to say something more judgmental. But, you said that because I needed it, and it helped."
    ―Moxxie, to Blitzo about his first day working at I.M.P

Our love is a story sweet to tell. Yeah you cast a special Satanic spell. Over my heart. Love is a journey we decided to start. Yeah, I hope we'll never ever be apart. I love you! (x6) ♫"
    ―Moxxie singing his song to Millie
%
    "♫ I love us, I love us just the way we are. Don't have to pretend to like to do things we don't. I've always got you around to laugh at my stupid jokes. I'll never take you for granted. I'll always give you my best. And if you can offer the same thing. We'll handle the rest. 'Cause I love you. 'Cause I love you. ♫"

%
    "Okay, first off - Dad, I'm bisexual."
    ―Moxxie, to Crimson, about his sexuality

    "Ugh. Just get out of here!"
    ―Moxxie, when seeing Chaz in his room

    ―Moxxie, when he is still harassed by Chaz
%
    "I said I'm not doing it, sir! I've spent my whole life being afraid of you, but I'm not letting you take the only good thing I've ever had so you can keep your fragile sense of control over everything. Millie is a good woman, a better woman than I deserve and nothing scares me more than hurting her, not even you. I'm leaving, Dad, and if you or Herpes the Clown over here try and stop me, you'll learn first hand just how good I've gotten at my job."
