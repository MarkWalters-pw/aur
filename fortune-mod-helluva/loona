    "Is it a cure for Syphilis?"
    ―Loona, asking about her gift
%
    "I'm hungover from this morning, dumbass!"
    ―Loona, to Millie, who questions her about drinking on a work night
%
    "You know what?! I can't take this assault right now! I need to blow off some fucking steam! Aaaaaaah!"
    ―Loona, hungover and enraged
%
    "Blitzo, that clingy rich asshole is on the phone. Says it's urgent and wants to talk to you. Sounds a little DTF-y."
    ―Loona, about Stolas
%
    "The only reason you have a wife is because you're easy to manage!"
    ―Loona, to Moxxie
%
    "Wow. I feel SO loved here."
    ―Loona, sarcastically when Millie says Moxxie might hit their only Hellhound
%
    "Hey, you don't know they're innocent! This kid probably sets dogs on fire. Maybe THIS girl gets off to bullying Australian kids online, and THIS guy… This guy DEFINITELY watches."
    ―Loona, when Moxxie implies the family in the picture she is holding might be innocent
%
    "You mean, our ONLY ticket to the other side? Yeah. Got it."
    ―Loona, when Blitzo asks about the condition of the grimoire

%
    "Shut up Da- Ugh! Blitzo!"
    ―Loona, to Blitzo
%
    "Hey, is there a way I can come with you guys this time?"
    ―Loona, asking if she can come with I.M.P to the human realm
%
    "Well, I can blend in with humans easy enough. Just let me tag along."
    ―Loona, about disgusing as a human
%
    "You three have been screwing around on Earth this whole fucking time, without human disguises?!"
    ―Loona, realizing Blitzo, Moxxie and Millie haven't been using human disguises
%
    "That's hot.... I mean, like, LITERALLY, y'know, 'cause vortexes...y'know, they give off heat. Probably. Right?"
    ―Loona, nervously chatting with Vortex
%
    "Oh, yeah. I wish I had friends. Haha, heh...I mean, I don't have any friends."
    ―Loona, to Vortex
%
    "Fuck, Blitzo! Why can't you stay out of my face for five minutes?!"
    ―Loona, yelling at Blitzo
%
    "Oh, what does it matter?! You’re not my real dad, I was almost eighteen! I didn't need you then, asshole! I don't, now!"
    ―Loona saying she doesn't need Blitzo
%

    ―Loona, to Moxxie
%

    ―Loona to Millie when she introduces her and Blitzo to her parents
%
    "Y'all don't deserve to know my name."
    ―Loona, to Millie's parents
%
    "That's what she said!"
    ―Loona, making fun of Blitzo
%
    "'Kay, I’m here."
    ―Loona, after kicking the door that slammed Moxxie
%
    "Blitzo was using a total of zero euphemisms, innuendos, or swears that means it was serious, which means I don't open it until-"
    ―Loona disputing Millie wanting to open the portal
%
    "It smells like they went this way. Come on... Let's find the dumbass twins."
    ―Loona, to Millie while tracking Blitzo and Moxxie's whereabouts
%
    "Damn, you're pretty agile for an old lady."
    ―Loona when seeing Millie killing the D.H.O.R.K.S guards
%
    "Get your asses out before more fuckers show up!"
    ―Loona helping Blitzo and Moxxie
%
    "DIE, MOTHERFUCKERS!"
    ―Loona, going full murder-wolf on agents while Blitzo proudly watches her
%
    "Shit! I can't- I can't read the spell in this light, I can't see dick!"
    ―Loona when trying to find a way out of D.H.O.R.K.S. headquarters

    ―Loona, making a conversation with Vikki and her friends
%
    "Uh, yeah. It's Loona… yeah."
    ―Loona, to Vikki
%
    "Oh, yeah? Well, maybe it's 'cus I'm in the presence of a massive bitch!"
    ―Loona, to Vikki
%
    "What? Is that not an okay thing to say? Like, come on, it's true!"
    ―Loona, to the partygoers
%
    "Oh, this is... she's hot."
    ―Loona, about Beezlebub
%
    "Nope, you really wouldn't like me after one drink."
    ―Loona, to Vortex
%
    "So stupid. I shouldn't have come."
    ―Loona, regretting for going to Beelzebub's party
%
    "I mean, we could stay a little longer."

    ―Loona, to Beelzebub and Vortex, about Blitzo
%
    "Don’t act like you know him like I do."
    ―Loona, to Beelzebub
%
    "Oh, yeah? And I bet you’d know the “okay” vibe, right? I mean everyone likes you so much."
    ―Loona, to Beelzebub
%
    "Sorry. Yeah, nope, I'll, uh... I'll check on him."
    ―Loona, to Beelzebub
%
    "Blitzo! Bliitzo! Where are you, shithead?! BLIT-"
    ―Loona, while looking for Blitzo
%
    "Oh, piss on a dick! What the fuck are you doing, Blitzo?!"
    ―Loona, to the drunk Blitzo, after finding him making out
%
    "It looks like you're in the middle of a goddamn orgy! Stop!"
    ―Loona, to the drunk Blitzo
%
    "You don't need anyone else sucking your face, freaky weirdo. You need to drink something other than Beelzejuice."
    ―Loona, to drunk Blitzo
%
    "Do you need to throw up?"
    ―Loona, asking Blitzo
%
    "Oh, yeah? Is that why you drank like five gallons worth of who-knows-what?"

    ―Loona, to Octavia about the sky filled with smog
%
    "You know, your dad's really worried about you."
    ―Loona, to Octavia about Stolas
%
    "Sometimes... sometimes it's not as simple as that. This kind of shit gets messy, and everybody's got issues, especially dads. And sometimes they fuck up -- well, all the time. But, that doesn't mean they don't care."
    ―Loona, to Octavia about dads
%
    "He's somewhere down there."
    ―Loona, to Octavia about Stolas
