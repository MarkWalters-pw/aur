By design, the wlroots compositor library does not support the proprietary NVIDIA driver. This patch remediates that by allowing rending with GLES2 when the driver is used.

This package is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the Arch wlroots0.17 package that sway relies on.

Instructions:
Build per the normal AUR package installation process.

Note:
If you are unable to install using 'makepkg -sri' due to a dependency error (this will be the case when sway is already installed), you may:

1. Uninstall the existing wlroots0.17 package first and re-run 'makepkg-sri'.
2. Run 'makepkg -sr', and then manually install the built package with pacman -Udd <pkgname>.
